**Woorpje Word Equation* is a word equation benchmark set, with 809 instances in total. The benchmarks were generated to evaluate the performance of the string solver Woorpje [1]. They range from theoretically-interesting cases to variations real-world applications.

The benchmark set consists of five tracks. 
* Track01 was produced by generating random strings, and replacing factors with variables at random, in a coherent fashion. This guarantees the existence of a solution. The generated word equations have at most 15 variables, 10 letters, and length 300. 


 of SMT-LIB string and regex instance suites that generated using StringFuzz [1], a modular string and regex fuzzer. This repository consists of two categories: one with new instances generated by StringFuzz (_generated_: 4170 instances); and another with
transformed instances generated from a small suite of industrial benchmarks
(_transformed_: 10682).
